<h1>The Recipe</h1>
</div>
<p>
  This recipe will forever have a special place in my heart. I come from a blue collar family and budget has always been a concern.
  Being able to make something the whole family will enjoy and all under $10, it's almost unheard of.
  I grew up with this recipe, it's such a part of my life that I have it memorized and no longer need any refrence to create this lovely tish from scratch.
  I love to share this recipe with my friends that I know are on a budget. I always love hearing them talk about how they tried it and ended up loving it.
  It warms my heart to know that the joy this recipe has brought me is shared by others as well.

  I created this website over the course of three weeks for my online media arts class.
  I'll be honest, it was kind of a struggle, but it's really cool to be able to see something come out of all the work that I've done.
  With the help of online lessons I was able to turn a series of simple commands and text documents into an actual functioning website.
  If you would of asked me even a year ago this is not what I expected I would be doing

  I'm a senior at the University of Montana about to graduate with a Bachelors in journalism and a minor in media arts.
  I always knew I wanted to do journalism, but the biggest question for me was how I would set myself apart from the crowd.
  Media Arts became that for me. Rather than being a political journalist or something of that nature and having a topic based specialty, I chose to diversify my skills.
  I chose to make my standout trait be my ability to work with technology. I've set myself up for my long term goal of working in multimedia journalism for online and magazine platforms.
