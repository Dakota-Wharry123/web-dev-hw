    <header> <h1> How to make <em>Poor man's stroganoff</em> </h1>
      <p> This recipe is a <strong>staple </strong> from my childhood. The meer mention of it brings back memories of dinner with my grandmother or dinner with my parents.
        <abbr title="Preparation"> Prep </abbr> time is about 15 <abbr title="minutes"> mins. </abbr> and cook time is about 45 mins. But being a casserole
        it can also be prepped, then put in the fridge and baked anytime within the next several days. <br />
        Just remember: <blockquote><q>It's a family secret, don't go telling everybody now.</q>- Josh Lachina</blockquote> </p>
