        <h2>About Colin</h2>
        <div class="paragraph-1">
        <p align"center">
            Colin Meloy once wrote Ray Bradbury a letter, informing him that he "considered himself an author too." He was ten. Since then, Colin has gone on to be the singer and songwriter for the band the Decemberists, where he channels all of his weird ideas into weird songs. With the Wildwood Chronicles, he is now channeling those ideas into novels.

        <h2>About Carson</h2>
        <p align"center">
          As a kid, Carson Ellis loved exploring the woods, drawing, and nursing wounded animals back to health. As an adult, little has changed—except she is now the acclaimed illustrator of several books for children, including Lemony Snicket’s The Composer Is Dead, Dillweed’s Revenge by Florence Parry Heide, and The Mysterious Benedict Society by Trenton Lee Stewart.

          Colin and Carson live with their son, Hank, in Portland, Oregon, quite near the Impassable Wilderness. (a large park near their home in Portland)
